# Coding-calculator
Its a calculator about arithmetic coding, shannon-fano coding, huffman coding, and lzw coding.

这是一个不完整的编码计算器。
它现在的版本是v0.4

about the calculator：

Arithmetic coding: u can just input a string, and u will get the Binary code. And calculation process absolutely.

Shannon-fano coding: put char and chances in the calculator, u can get the Binary code of the char.But u can not get the picture of calculation process.

huffman coding: u can not get the Binary code if u put the chars in. But u can get entropy and efficiency when u put the Binary code, char and chances.

lzw coding: u can type string in the calculator and get the output string and calculation process. But there is some bugs that in the function of 'serch_dictionary' perhaps. So it maight be crash sometimes.
